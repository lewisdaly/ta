## Session

### Questions
- Individual projects - how are we going?
  - Feel free to email me with some ideas, and we can talk about them
- Group projects

### Tools of the trade: Debugging network requests
- Postman
- Curl
- Swagger

### Let's talk about: Network requests

*Old:* SOAP & XML
*Current:* REST & JSON
**note: SOAP and REST aren't directly comparable, but these are good terms to search for**
*Next:*
- GraphQL (A new query language that works on top of REST)
- gRPC - lower level, more efficent. Based on http remote procedure calls. This method has been championed by Google

Generally, apps aren't that useful without networking.

Things to think about:
- latency
- connectivity issues
- dealing with errors
  - eg. using http status codes (500, 400, 404, 401, 403, 504, 418 (I'm a teapot))



### Build an app with firebase + react native
- Bowl app
