## Maps example:

We are going to use AirBnb's react-native-maps node module to make working with maps a little easier.
Ref: https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps

installation:
```
yarn add react-native-maps            #install the modules
react-native link react-native-maps   #link the native dependencies
```


*Checkpoint 1: broken maps, Native component for "AIRMap" does not exist*
`git checkout wk_4_1`

- The fix? Starting again after linking the binaries ;)

*Checkpoint 2: geolocation*
- Let's add a button to find the user's current position

- Now, we need to configure the permissions for Android an iOS respectively
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/geolocation.html

> Geolocation is enabled by default when you create a project with react-native init. (for iOS)

Hooray!





- connect with maps, geolocation
- naive search and filter
- React Native + Camera!
