## Maps example:

We are going to use AirBnb's react-native-maps node module to make working with maps a little easier.
Ref: https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps

installation:
```
yarn add react-native-maps            #install the modules
react-native link react-native-maps   #link the native dependencies
```



- connect with maps, geolocation
- React Native + Camera!
